    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Cuba Libre, meaning “Free Cuba,” is one of the most popular Cuban cocktails in existence, along with the classic Daiquiri and the Mojito. While the combination of rum, Coke and lime may seem simple, within those three ingredients lies a synergy that has pleased palates for over a century. </p>
        <p>The Cuba Libre’s creation can be traced to early 1900s Havana, shortly after the Spanish-American War. While there are variations on the Cuba Libre’s origin story, the dominant narrative attributes the drink to a U.S. Army captain living in Havana after being stationed there for the war. One day, while celebrating Cuba’s victory at a local bar, the captain added Coca-Cola and a little lime juice to his Bacardí rum and toasted his Cuban comrades by exclaiming, “Por Cuba Libre!” (“To a free Cuba!”), which was the slogan of the Cuban independence movement. The drink—and the name—stuck.</p>
