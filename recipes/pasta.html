        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe takes inspiration from a classic pasta al limone by using heavy cream as the base for the luscious and decadent sauce.</p>
            <p>It comes together in under 30 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 c. torn pitted Castelvetrano or green olives</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>1/3 c. gin or vodka</li>
                <li>2/3 c. heavy cream</li>
                <li>2/3 c. finely grated Parmesan</li>
                <li>1/3 c. chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add olives, garlic, and lemon zest and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add gin and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about half, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add cream, olive brine, pasta, and 1/2 cup reserved pasta water. Cook, tossing constantly and adding more pasta water as needed, until pasta is coated and sauce is emulsified, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in Parmesan, parsley, and butter until butter is melted; season with salt. Top with more Parmesan before serving.</li>
